🚀 Excited to share my latest full-stack project - **Vahan Bazar** - a comprehensive two-wheeler marketplace!

After months of development, I've built a complete platform that showcases modern web development practices and real-world application of full-stack skills.

🏍️ **What makes this special:**
• Complete marketplace with 28+ bike listings
• Advanced filtering & search functionality  
• EMI & Fuel Cost Calculators
• Test Ride Booking System
• Admin Dashboard with Analytics
• Secure JWT Authentication
• Mobile-responsive design

🛠️ **Tech Stack:**
React 18.2.0 | Node.js | Express.js | MySQL | Tailwind CSS | Vercel

🎯 **Try it live:** https://vahan-bazar-vb.vercel.app/

This project demonstrates my ability to build production-ready applications from concept to deployment. The journey taught me so much about scalable architecture, user experience design, and modern development practices.
